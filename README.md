# Traffic_sign_Detection

  This project https://github.com/sruthi720/Traffic_sign_Detection is a traffic signs detection and classification system on videos using OpenCV. 
   Image Processing techniques  used here to detect the circles and ellipses on the video by the contures.

   #### FILES :
   
   It consist 3 python files which includes,
   
   1. [main.py](main.py) -> starting of the program
    
   2. [classification.py](classification.py) -> to classify the signs
    
   3. [common.py](common.py) ->fuction for defining svm model
   
        and other files are svm file ,[data_svm.dat](data_svm.dat)-> svm model after training  and [README.md](README.md)
  
  #### DATASET :
  
  
   The Dataset folder contains images for training SVM models.It has 12 folders.
