# Traffic_sign_Detection

  This project https://github.com/sruthi720/Traffic_sign_Detection is a traffic signs detection and classification system on videos using OpenCV. 
   Image Processing techniques  used here to detect the circles and ellipses on the video by the contures.
  
  Requirements are Python 3.5,OpenCV3, Imutils (use -> pip3 install imutils  to install).
  It consist 3 python files which includes main.py, classification.py, common.py  and other files are svm file and README.
 
  DATASET: The Dataset folder contains images for training SVM models.It has 12 folders.
  
  RESULT of the project is https://github.com/sruthi720/Traffic_sign_Detection/blob/master/demo.gif
